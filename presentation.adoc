= Docs-as-Code for Open-Source Medical Hardware & PPE's

by Sean Marquez

== Context

Circa March 2020 - Present

Note:
Case spikes throughout the COVID pandemic have caused shortages in medical supplychain

== Call to Action

Form an engineering thinktank

Note:
To build open-source medical hardware!

== Roadblocks

- Regulatory environment
- Available toolchain

Note:
Not to mention, working with distributed team members, over 4 time zones, across 2 countries

== What is open-Source Hardware (OSHW)

OSHW Definition (source: OSHWA):

- OSHW s/b like OSSW
- Tools used to develop OSHW should also be open-source

== Realization

Tools for documenting open-source hardware are virtually non-existent

== Write The Docs

A community for technical writers & documentarians (to the rescue!)

== Docs-as-Code

The philosophy that documentation should be maintained using the same tools & approach as code

== Advantages to Docs-as-Code

- Works with distributed version control systems (s.a., git)
- Allows for parallel development; documenting an in-development "feature" (using branches)
- Reviewing documentation is like a code review

Note:
- satisfies traceability requirements
- GH code reviews for documentation satisfies Q/A
