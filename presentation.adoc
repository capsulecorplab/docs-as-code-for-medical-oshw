= Docs-as-Code for Open-Source Medical Hardware & PPE's

by Sean Marquez

== Context

[%step]
Circa March 2020 - Present

[.notes]
--
Case spikes throughout the COVID pandemic have caused shortages in medical supplychain
--

== Call to Action

[%step]
Form an engineering thinktank

[.notes]
--
To build open-source medical hardware!
--

== Roadblocks

[%step]
- Regulatory environment
- How to build open-source hardware (OSHW)

[.notes]
--
Not to mention, working with distributed team members, over 4 time zones, across 2 countries

=== 21 CFR Part 820 subparts

[%step]
- Subpart B—Quality System Requirements
- Subpart C—Design Controls
- Subpart D—Document Controls
- Subpart E—Purchasing Controls
- Subpart F—Identification and Traceability
- Subpart G—Production and Process Controls
- Subpart H—Acceptance Activities
- Subpart I—Nonconforming Product
- Subpart J—Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)
- Subpart K—Labeling and Packaging Control
- Subpart L—Handling, Storage, Distribution, and Installation
- Subpart M—Records
- Subpart N—Servicing
- Subpart O—Statistical Techniques

=== TL;DR

"Manufacturers of medical devices shall ensure that finished devices will be safe and effective."

== How-to build Open-Source Hardware (OSHW)

=== OSHW Definition

[%step]
- OSHW s/b like OSSW;
  license & design should allow for anyone to make, modify, and/or redistribute the hardware

 (source: OSHWA)

- Documentation & design tools themselves should be accessible and open-source

 (source: OSHWA)

== Realization

[%step]
Tools for documenting open-source hardware are virtually non-existent

== Meet _Write The Docs_

[%step]
_A community for technical writers & documentarians_

== Docs-as-Code

[%step]
_The philosophy that documentation should be maintained using the same tools & approach as code_

== Advantages to Docs-as-Code

[%step]
- Works with distributed version control systems (s.a., git)
- Allows for parallel development
- Reviewing documentation is like a code review
- Documentation itself can be open-sourced, allowing anyone to contribute

[.notes]
--
- satisfies traceability requirements
- GH code reviews for documentation satisfies Q/A
- "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" - Linus' Law

== How to adopt a Docs-as-Code approach

[%step]
- Language
- Toolchain
- Methodology

=== Language

[%step]
- Markup Language
- Template Language
- Modeling Language

=== Toolchain

[%step]
- Text Editor
- Version Control System
- Static Site Generator / Rendering Engine
- Automation Pipeline

=== Methodology

[%step]
- Workflow
- Contributing guidelines (s.a., style guide)
- Documentation review process

== Examples

<PAPRa docs screenshot>

== In-Development

Adopting a framework for OSHW,
untethered from vendor lock-in or content management systems (CMS),
that allows for the generation of

- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Purchase Orders (PO)
- Assembly instructions
- Design Documentation

s.a., the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF)
